Rails 3 removes the deprecated SQLite 2 adapter. We strongly recommend that you upgrade to SQLite 3 or higher. However, if that's not possible due to the unexplainable reasons, then this plugin should do the job.

Install
=======

* Install the plugin :

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/rails/sqlite2_adapter.git

* Load the database adapter from your environment.rb

    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
      .....

      Rails::Initializer.default.add :initialize_sqlite2, :before => :initialize_database do
        require 'active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite2_adapter'
      end
    end

That's it.
